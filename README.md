Multi-Defendant Identification Pipeline
# This is the tool using pipeline workflow in purpose to identify and separate the defenfant identities in multi-defendant cases.

Models have been built using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and pre-trained language models such as BERT, which can classify text and identify principals and accomplices.

Train the model: The model will feature the relationship between two defendants in the text (By BERT) and classify the text according to the relationship, which will be divided into three categories.
